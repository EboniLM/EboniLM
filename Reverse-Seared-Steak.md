### The Preparation

- 2 medium Ribeye Steaks (~1.2 lbs.)
- 3 tbsp. Bacon Fat (or other high smoke point oil)
- Salt and Pepper to Taste

### The Execution

1. Preheat oven to 250F. Put your steaks on a wire rack on top of a cookie sheet. Season heavily with salt and pepper on all sides.
2. Stick an instant-read thermometer through the side of the steak. Bake in the oven until internal temperature of 123F is reached.
3. Heat the bacon grease in a cast iron skillet and wait until the pan is very hot. Place the steaks in and sear for 30 - 45 seconds on each side.
