### Preparation
#### Dry Ingredients:
- 2.5 cups plain flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ cup sugar

#### Wet ingredients
- 2 eggs lightly whisked
- ⅔ cup oil 
- 1 cup Greek yogurt (full, fat, and strained)
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract optional

#### Other
- 1.5 cups chocolate chips

### Execution
- Pre-heat the oven to 355F/180C and line a muffin pan with muffin liners. Spray lightly with oil.
- Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl.
- Combine the wet ingredients in a jug or smaller bowl.
- Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix with a wooden spoon until just combined (a few lumps are fine. Don’t overmix.)
- Gently fold the chocolate chips into the batter.
- Spoon the batter into the muffin cases (you can fill almost to the top) and bake for 17 to 25 minutes. After 17 minutes keep checking every couple of minutes. A skewer pushed into the centre of the muffin should come out without raw batter on it, and the muffins should be nicely golden brown.
- Let cool completely on a wire rack before eating so that the muffin cases don’t stick. Reheat for 15 seconds in the microwave after peeling off the muffin case if you’d like to enjoy a muffin warm!
